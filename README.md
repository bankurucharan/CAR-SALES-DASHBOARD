The above dashboard is used to total selling prices from 1994 to 2020 and KM drive various car brands. 

1.High Total Kilometers Driven:-

Insight: Brands with high total kilometers driven are often associated with reliability and long-term usage. For example, if a brand like Toyota shows high total kilometers, it might indicate that owners keep these cars for longer periods, relying on them for extensive use.

2.Identifying High-Selling Years:-
Insight: Years with significantly higher total selling prices indicate periods when more vehicles were sold, or higher-priced vehicles were popular. This could be due to favorable market conditions, successful marketing campaigns, or the release of popular new models.

3.Low and hign Number of Owners:-
Insight: Brands with a higher average number of owners could imply that vehicles change hands more frequently, which may be due to various factors such as higher maintenance costs, quicker depreciation, or targeting a more transient customer base. For example, luxury brands like BMW or Mercedes might show a higher average number of owners, as these vehicles are often leased or resold after a few years.

Conclusion
The dashboard serves as a powerful tool for making data-driven decisions. Whether you're a dealership manager looking to optimize inventory, a sales team tracking performance, or a customer comparing options, the insights provided will help you understand market dynamics, set competitive prices, and ultimately achieve your goals.
